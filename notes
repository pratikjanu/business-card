1) here we use the flex box property after wrapping the elements other than image in a new div and then applying flex on the parent div (i.e. whole card).

2) now we use a utility class that means we make a separate class for a particular css property (say border) then we can just give that clas to as many elements we want in our html file so ee wont have to create it separate for very class/ element!
